# Howdy! 👋 I'm Kenny

I create expansive virtual worlds with web technology. I'm a Linguist-turned-programmer interested in answering the question "what gives a virtual world a sense of place"?
I'd be delighted if my tools or libraries can help you in your game project or help you develop a setting to DM a session of your favorite TTRPG.

Latest projects:
- 🌍 [Hello Worlds](https://worlds.kenny.wtf/), a collection of libraries to build virtual javascript worlds at planetary scales
- ⛰️ [TerrainSynth](https://terrain-synth.kenny.wtf/), generate terrains using machine-learning and real-earth datasets
