I want to create expansive virtual worlds with web technology. 
I'd be delighted if my tools or libraries can help you in your game project or help you develop a setting to DM a session of your favorite TTRPG.

Latest projects:
- 🌍 [Hello Worlds](https://worlds.kenny.wtf/), a collection of libraries to build virtual javascript worlds at planetary scales
