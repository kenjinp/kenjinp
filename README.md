# Howdy! 👋 I'm Kenny

I want to create expansive virtual worlds with web technology. I'd be delighted if my tools or libraries can help you in your game project or help you develop a setting to DM a session of your favorite TTRPG. 


You can find my latest projects here: 
- 🌍 [Hello Worlds](https://worlds.kenny.wtf/), a collection of libraries to build virtual javascript worlds at planetary skills.

Get in touch! Find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/KennyPirman) or [the Poimandres Discord](https://discord.gg/aAYjm2p7c7).
